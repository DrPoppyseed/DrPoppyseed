I'm a Full Stack developer based in Tokyo. I write Rust on my job, and have experience working with Typescript and React, and dabble in other things from time to time. 
I love the safety Rust's type system gives me (not to mention the awesome compiler warnings), but also love the flexibility of Typescript's.
